The objective was to develop a desktop application that could be used in a real context, where previously studied object-oriented programming concepts were used. It was decided to create an employee management application with the ability to insert records, search them, calculate their salary, as well as other features. Depending on the first position (superclass), the remaining positions (subclasses, as well as subclasses of subclasses) would be created. These would be assigned certain parameters that differentiated them.
